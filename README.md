## Overview
### Description
Problem: Throughout the course of college, students accumulate a variety of objects that often go to waste, especially regarding reusable items like books or clothes. The pandemic has posed an additional barrier when it comes to the spread and sharing of personal belongings. 
Tri-Eco aims to reduce waste by providing a safe and easy method for students to donate and access reusable resources available within campus. In the Tri-Co, there is no site which can be used for safe utilization of the unused possessions of the students. Thus, the goal of our app is to create a centralized platform where Tri-Co students can buy, donate, and sell their belongings from each other. The items can include used or completely new books, clothes, stationery, interior/design items, or even furniture. We want to encourage students to be reasonable consumers and make more sustainable choices that will contribute to the overall ecological landscape of our planet.


### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Retail/Environment
- **Mobile:** This app is designed for android mobile devices only 
- **Story:** Reduces waste by providing a centralized platform that connects buyers and sellers of donations/used items (clothes, books, household supplies etc.) across the Tri-Co. 
- **Market:**Students of the Tri-co (Bryn Mawr College, Haverford College, Swarthmore College)
- **Habit:**This app will most likely be used often for as long as any student would like to buy an item from the app or sell one of their own items. 
- **Scope:** Our goal is to allow students from the Tri-Co community to engage in a more sustainable lifestyle. As the app develops, we hope to expand the app to others outside of the Tri-Co.
