# Tri-Eco
A mobile application which students of the Tri-Co Consortium can use to sell, donate and buy belongings from each other that they would otherwise throw away. We want to encourage students to be reasonable consumers and make more sustainable choices that will contribute to the overall ecological landscape of our planet.
